primeminder-salt
================

These states are used for Primeminder
(https://github.com/gravyboat/primeminder) service configurations. By default
port 443 is actively redirecting for SSL. So for initial configuration you
will have to disable the redirect so that LetsEncrypt can properly set up the
SSL certificate.
